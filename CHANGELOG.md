# Changelog

All notable changes to nfm are documented here.

## [1.0.3] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- **Rename files and folders** — press `F2` or `e` on any entry to rename it
  inline; full editing support: Left/Right cursor, Home/End, Delete, Backspace,
  UTF-8-aware; `ESC` cancels, `Enter` confirms

### Fixed
- **Garbled Unicode / emoji in filenames on Linux** — the binary now links
  against `libncursesw` (wide-character ncurses) instead of narrow `libncurses`;
  emoji, umlauts and other multi-byte characters in filenames now render
  correctly in the file menu and browser on all Linux distributions
- **Filename truncation could split UTF-8 sequences** in the Actions popup;
  now backs up to a safe character boundary before inserting `…`

---

## [1.0.2] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- **Filter-as-you-type in file browser** — press `/` to open the filter bar and
  start typing; the listing narrows in real-time to entries whose names contain
  the typed substring (case-insensitive, UTF-8-aware: typing `ün` finds
  `München`, typing `3` finds `123` and `367`)
- Filter bar shows match count while active (`/foo  (3 matches)`)
- `ESC` while typing closes the bar but keeps the filter; `ESC` again (or
  backspace on an empty bar) clears the filter entirely
- Arrow keys work normally during filtering so you can navigate while searching

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Garbled characters on macOS and Linux** — `setlocale(LC_ALL, "")` is now
  called before `initscr()` so ncurses uses UTF-8; this fixes garbage output
  for any multi-byte terminal characters
- **Umlaut / special-character filenames on macOS** — same locale fix; NFD-
  composed filenames (ä ö ü etc.) now display correctly in the browser
- Replaced raw Unicode symbols in footer/menu strings with ASCII equivalents
  as additional fallback for non-UTF-8 terminals

### Added
- **Media-only browser filter** (`m` key) — hides non-processable files
  (`.docx`, `.txt`, executables …) so only video, audio and image files plus
  directories are shown; `[media]` indicator appears in the browser title bar
  when the filter is active
